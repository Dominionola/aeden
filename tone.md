# Voice, Tone & Messaging Standards

## BRAND VOICE

### Core Personality
Aeden speaks like a helpful builder friend who:
- Gets the struggle of creating content after a long day
- Celebrates small wins, not just big launches
- Knows tech but doesn't show off
- Cuts through BS, gets to the point
- Believes building > talking about building

**We are:** Direct, encouraging, real  
**We are NOT:** Corporate, salesy, robotic, overly enthusiastic

---

## TONE SPECTRUM

### When to use each tone:

**Casual (Default - 70% of copy):**
- ✅ "What did you work on today?"
- ✅ "Your posts are looking good 👍"
- ✅ "AI couldn't generate this one. Try different input?"
- ❌ "Please provide input regarding your daily accomplishments"
- ❌ "Congratulations! Your content is performing excellently!"
- ❌ "An error has occurred during the generation process"

**Professional (Documentation, settings - 20%):**
- ✅ "Connect your GitHub account to auto-generate posts from commits"
- ✅ "Engagement data syncs every 6 hours"
- ❌ "Integrate GitHub repository connectivity for automated content generation"
- ❌ "Engagement metrics undergo synchronization bi-quarterly daily"

**Motivational (Empty states, milestones - 10%):**
- ✅ "First post published! The hard part's done. Keep going."
- ✅ "10 posts published. You're building momentum."
- ❌ "Congratulations on this momentous achievement!"
- ❌ "You're absolutely crushing it! Way to go, superstar!"

---

## FORBIDDEN WORDS & PHRASES

### ❌ NEVER USE THESE (AI Slop Red Flags):

**Overly Enthusiastic:**
- "Delighted to announce"
- "Thrilled to share"
- "Excited to introduce"
- "I'm incredibly proud"
- "Absolutely amazing"
- "Truly honored"
- "Deeply grateful"
- "Blown away by"

**Corporate Jargon:**
- "Leverage"
- "Synergy"
- "Ecosystem"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Best-in-class"
- "Leading provider"
- "Solutions"
- "Empower"
- "Transform"
- "Innovate"

**Generic AI-isms:**
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "As we move forward"
- "At the end of the day"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "Here's the thing"
- "Let's dive in"
- "Let me tell you"
- "The truth is"
- "In conclusion"

**Overused Startup-speak:**
- "We're building the X for Y"
- "Think Uber but for Z"
- "Disrupting the industry"
- "10x better than"
- "The future of work"

---

## PREFERRED ALTERNATIVES

### ✅ USE THESE INSTEAD:

**Instead of excitement words:**
- ❌ "Thrilled to announce" → ✅ "Just launched" / "Here's what's new"
- ❌ "Incredibly excited to share" → ✅ "Made something" / "Shipped this"
- ❌ "Deeply honored to" → ✅ "Happy to" / "Glad to"

**Instead of corporate speak:**
- ❌ "Leverage our platform" → ✅ "Use Aeden to"
- ❌ "Transform your workflow" → ✅ "Make posting easier"
- ❌ "Empower creators" → ✅ "Help you post more"

**Instead of AI filler:**
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced world, content creation is challenging" → ✅ "Creating content takes time you don't have"
- ❌ "At the end of the day, consistency matters" → ✅ "Posting consistently is hard"
- ❌ "Here's the thing about building in public" → ✅ "Building in public works because..."

---

## WRITING PATTERNS

### 1. Hero Headlines (Landing Page)
**Formula:** Problem → Solution (8-12 words max)

✅ Examples:
- "Stop overthinking posts. Start sharing progress."
- "Turn your work into posts, automatically."
- "Build in public without the content burnout."

❌ Bad examples:
- "Revolutionary AI-Powered Platform for Seamless Content Generation"
- "Empower Your Social Media Strategy with Cutting-Edge Automation"
- "The Future of Building in Public Starts Here"

**Pattern:**
- Lead with the pain (overthinking, burnout, time)
- Promise relief (not transformation)
- Keep it under 12 words
- Use periods, not exclamation marks

### 2. Feature Descriptions
**Formula:** What it does + Why it matters (No fluff)

✅ Good:
```
AI generates posts from your GitHub commits. 
So you can ship code, not tweets.
```

```
Connect Notion. Turn task updates into posts. 
Your work speaks for itself.
```

❌ Bad:
```
Our revolutionary AI-powered content generation engine leverages 
cutting-edge machine learning to transform your GitHub commits 
into engaging, highly-optimized social media content.
```

**Pattern:**
- First sentence: What happens
- Second sentence: Why you care
- No adjectives before "AI" (smart, powerful, advanced)
- No "seamlessly," "effortlessly," "simply"

### 3. Button Copy
**Formula:** Verb + Noun (2-3 words)

✅ Good:
- "Generate Post"
- "Connect GitHub"
- "Publish Now"
- "Save Draft"
- "Try Example"

❌ Bad:
- "Click Here to Generate Your Post"
- "Get Started with GitHub Integration"
- "Publish Your Awesome Content Now!"
- "Save as Draft for Later"

**Context-specific buttons:**
- When user has no posts: ✅ "Create First Post" | ❌ "Begin Your Journey"
- When post is ready: ✅ "Publish to Threads" | ❌ "Share With The World"
- When user hasn't connected source: ✅ "Connect a Source" | ❌ "Unlock Automation"

### 4. Empty States
**Formula:** Acknowledge + Action (Encouraging, not pushy)

✅ Good:
- "No posts yet. Create your first one?"
- "Nothing scheduled. Want to queue something up?"
- "Connect GitHub to see your commits here."

❌ Bad:
- "You haven't created any amazing content yet! Let's get started!"
- "Oops! Looks like there's nothing here. Why not create something?"
- "Your dashboard is empty. Time to start your journey!"

**Progressive empty states:**
```
// First visit
"No posts yet"
[Create First Post]

// After first post
"Your first post is live. Keep the momentum going."
[Create Another]

// After 10 posts
"10 posts published. You're consistent."
[Keep Going]
```

### 5. Error Messages
**Formula:** What happened + What to do (No apologizing unless we broke something)

✅ Good:
- "Couldn't generate post. Try different input?"
- "GitHub connection expired. Reconnect to continue."
- "Post too long. Trim to 500 characters."

❌ Bad:
- "Oops! Something went wrong! We're so sorry!"
- "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
- "Uh oh! Looks like we hit a snag!"

**When to apologize:**
- ✅ "Our bad. AI is down. We're fixing it." // Our service failed
- ✅ "Sorry, we lost your draft. That's on us." // We broke something
- ❌ "Sorry, you entered invalid input." // User error
- ❌ "Apologies, but your post is too long." // User needs to fix

### 6. Success Messages
**Formula:** Confirmation + Next step (Brief, not celebratory)

✅ Good:
- "Post published. View on Threads →"
- "GitHub connected. Ready to generate posts."
- "Draft saved. Publish when ready."

❌ Bad:
- "Success! Your post has been published successfully!"
- "Congratulations! GitHub integration complete!"
- "Woohoo! Your draft is safely saved!"

**Toast notifications:**
```javascript
toast.success("Published")  // One word when obvious
toast.success("Draft saved")  // Two words max
toast.error("Publish failed")  // State the fact
toast.info("Syncing engagement...")  // Ongoing action
```

### 7. Onboarding Copy
**Formula:** Question + Benefit (Make it about them, not us)

**Step 1:**
- ✅ "What type of work do you do?" "We'll suggest the right integrations."
- ❌ "Welcome to Aeden! We're excited to have you!" "Let's set up your profile to get started on your journey!"

**Step 2:**
- ✅ "Connect a source to auto-generate posts, or skip and start manually."
- ❌ "Now let's supercharge your workflow with our powerful integrations!"

**Step 3:**
- ✅ "What did you work on this week?" "We'll turn it into a post to show you how it works."
- ❌ "Let's create some amazing content together!"

### 8. Tooltips & Helper Text
**Formula:** Explain briefly (No hand-holding)

✅ Good:
- "Posts with images get 2-3x more engagement"
- "We sync engagement every 6 hours"
- "AI learns from your edits"

❌ Bad:
- "Pro tip: Did you know that posts with images tend to perform better?"
- "For your convenience, we automatically sync engagement data"
- "Our intelligent AI system learns from your editing patterns"

### 9. Settings & Documentation
**Formula:** Clear label + Short explanation (When needed)

✅ Good:
```
Tone: Casual
"Friendly and conversational"
```

❌ Bad:
```
Writing Tone Configuration:
"Select your preferred tone of voice for AI-generated content 
 to ensure optimal engagement"
```

✅ Good:
```
Auto-generate on sync
"Create draft when new work detected"
```

❌ Bad:
```
Automated Content Generation on Synchronization:
"Enable automatic content generation when new activity 
 is detected across integrated platforms"
```

## VOICE CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- ✅ Would I say this to a friend over coffee?
- ✅ Is this under 20 words? (If not, can it be?)
- ✅ Did I remove all "delighted/thrilled/excited"?
- ✅ Did I avoid "leverage/synergy/empower"?
- ✅ Is this about the user, not us?
- ✅ Would I roll my eyes reading this?
- ✅ Does this sound human?

**If you answered "no" to any → Rewrite.**

---

## QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

### When Writing UI Copy:

**DO:**
- Use contractions (you're, we're, can't)
- Start sentences with "You" when relevant
- Use active voice
- Keep it short (under 15 words when possible)
- Be specific ("5 posts" not "some posts")
- Use real numbers, not ranges
- End with periods, not exclamation marks

**DON'T:**
- Use emojis in serious contexts (errors, settings)
- Add "just" or "simply" (patronizing)
- Say "please" in buttons
- Use "very" or "really" (weak words)
- Write in third person
- Use passive voice
- Add filler words

## FINAL RULE

**When in doubt, cut 50% of your copy.**  
**If it still makes sense, cut another 25%.**

Users scan. They don't read. Respect their time.

Every word should earn its place on the page. If it doesn't add clarity or drive action, delete it. ✂️
